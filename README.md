Promoting social justice by contributing to F/OSS - Women Who Code Hackathon - October 2017 🚺 ✌️

## Overview

The open source "movement" seems to be gaining momentum due to a variety of factors. One beneficial use of open source software is the potential to help promote social justice. By lowering financial and intellectual property barriers, F/OSS can be used to bridge digital divides. At the core of social justice is the notion of equality of opportunity. Through the use of F/OSS, information technology literacy can be promoted among groups that might not otherwise have access to the tools necessary to build such literacy. This paper reports on an ongoing project that embodies this idea within a service learning context. While the project is in its emergent stages, early indications are that it has considerable potential.

The adoption of free software discourse among these newer groups is also having a recursive effect upon the free software movement by encouraging free software advocates to conceptualize F/OSS as part of a broader movement of digital rights and social justice. In the conclusion, the prospects for the emergence of a larger technological and cultural freedom movement in the future are assessed.
