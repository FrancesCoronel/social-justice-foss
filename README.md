Promoting social justice by contributing to F/OSS - Women Who Code Hackathon - October 2017 🚺 ✌️

## Overview

At the core of social justice is the notion of equality of opportunity.

Through the use of F/OSS, tech literacy can be promoted among groups that might not otherwise have access to the tools necessary to build such literacy.

By contributing to open-source projects, we are not only helping promote social justice but also aiding to bridging the digital divide by lowering financial and intellectual property barriers to resources and knowledge.

Our presentation is hosted through Google Slides.

## Goals

- [ ] create presentation showcasing contributions
- [ ] everyone learns how to contribute to F/OSS
- [ ] at least one contribution per team member
- [ ] showcase of contributions through this `README`

## Judging Criteria

### Innovation

> Does the solution solve a problem in a creative way?

Most hackathons focus on short-term development where the projects don't ever get touched again afterward.

By contributing to open-source projects that are already being actively used by others, we are not only ensuring long-term success but a broader impact.

### Technical Achievement

> Did the participant solve a hard technical problem? Did they get a working demo completed within the allotted time?

#### Contributions

We contributed to 6 different open-source projects.

- [First Aide iOS](https://github.com/systers/FirstAide-iOS)
  - Mobile app for Peace Corp volunteers so they can readily have access to report or gain information on Peace Corps Safety and Security procedures.
- [freeCodeCamp Guides](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/guides#article-style-guide)
  - A collection of easy-to-understand guides to programming tools
- [Girl Develop It Website](https://github.com/girldevelopit/gdi-website)
  - This is the official repository for the Girl Develop It website.
- [Women Who Code Guidelines & Resources](https://github.com/WomenWhoCode/guidelines-resources)
  - Where Women Who Code chapters will gather resources and guidelines for WWC chapters.
- [Jail Dash](https://github.com/codeforamerica/jail-dash)
  - A tool to help jail administrators, judges, and other stakeholders understand the conditions in metro jails, and use this data to visualize how their decisions–at both the individual and policy level–affect program, facility, and inmate outcomes.

#### Technologies Used

We used the following technologies when contributing to these projects!

- Docker
- HTML/CSS/JS
- Markdown
- Swift

### Impressiveness

> How impressive is the project? Did they complete the project?

We have yet to get a PR merged because it's a Saturday and open-source takes time for the maintainer to review the changes, make comments and ultimately approve the changes we've made.

### Impact on Social Good

> Is the project related to social justice?

This project encourages the conceptualization of free open-source software (`F/OSS`) as part of a broader movement of digital rights and social justice.
